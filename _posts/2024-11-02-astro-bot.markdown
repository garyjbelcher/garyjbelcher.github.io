I've just completed the excellent [Astro Bot](https://www.metacritic.com/game/astro-bot/) on PlayStation 5 and thoroughly enjoyed it. It's such an imaginative game full of PlayStation nostalgia. I particularly enjoyed the Horizon and Uncharted levels. I've still got various things to collect and that all-important Platinum trophy to get, so I still have many more hours left in the game to enjoy.
