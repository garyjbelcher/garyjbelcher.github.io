If you followed the blog on my old site, you'd know I'm an ice hockey fan, and I used to stay up late into the night to listen in on the games of my adopted team, the [Washington Capitals](https://www.nhl.com/capitals/). Whilst I don't follow the game as closely any more, I had to write a post to congratulate Capitals captain Alex Ovechkin on [scoring his 895th career goal and becoming the NHL's highest all-time goal scorer](https://www.bbc.com/sport/ice-hockey/articles/cjwv02e5j3xo). That's some achievement!
