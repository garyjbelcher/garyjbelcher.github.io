I recently finished watching [Shogun](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2788316/) on Disney+, and I highly recommend it. It's a fabulous showâ€”outstanding in every aspect. The acting, visual effects, and drama are all top-notch, and it truly deserves all the awards it is likely to receive. A friend gave me the novel that inspired the show, but I never got around to reading it. I think it's time to change that!
