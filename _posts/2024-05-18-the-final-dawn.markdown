I finished reading another book off my Want to Read shelf on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/) earlier this week. It was another space opera-type novel called The Final Dawn by [T.W.M. Ashford](https://www.twmashford.com/). The story was intriguing, and it kept me entertained throughout. There are seven more books in the series, which I've added to my Want to Read shelf on Goodreads.
