Solstice 2025 just concluded in [Destiny 2](https://www.metacritic.com/game/destiny-2/), and it's fair to say it was one of the most rewarding events ever! I managed to significantly increase my power level and pick up some sweet high-tiered gear, as well as guild the event title, something I've never done before. Props to [Bungie](https://www.bungie.net/) for a fantastic event. It's going to be quite jarring to go back to the awful non-event levelling and gear tiering system, though.
