While I'm very excited about the upcoming Champions League matches at Villa Park, I was most disappointed with the ticket prices when [Villa](http://www.avfc.co.uk/) announced them. All four matches will cost £79, a total of £316, and that's on top of my £818 season ticket! I'm fortunate I have the disposable income to afford it, but many supporters will sadly be priced out. It's a sign of the times, I guess, and I don't like it one bit.
