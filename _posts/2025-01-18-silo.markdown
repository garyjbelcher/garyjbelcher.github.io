I've just started watching the second season of [Silo](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14688458/) on [Apple TV+](https://tv.apple.com/). The first season was excellent. The visual effects are outstanding, with Silo 18 looking as I had imagined it from the books by [Hugh Howey](https://hughhowey.com/). It has been a while since I've read them, but the show stays faithful to the source material. And the good news is at least another two seasons are coming after this one!
