I'm a massive fan of LEGO games and the Horizon franchise, so I was excited to play [LEGO Horizon Adventures](https://www.metacritic.com/game/lego-horizon-adventures/) on PlayStation 5. I finished the game yesterday and earned the Platinum trophy. While it's one of the best-looking LEGO games, and the humour was spot-on, it doesn't quite measure up to past games created by TT Games, which is a shame.
