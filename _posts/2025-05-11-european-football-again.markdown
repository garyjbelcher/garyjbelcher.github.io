Aston Villa will play European football for the third season in a row, [following their 1-0 win this evening at Bournemouth](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/live/cvgp2j0v505t). It could be the Champions League or the Europa League. Whichever one it is, that is a fantastic achievement. And speaking of achievements, congratulations to Ollie Watkins on becoming Villa's all-time top goal scorer!
