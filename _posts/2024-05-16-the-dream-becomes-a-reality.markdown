[Aston Villa](https://www.avfc.co.uk/) will play [Champions League football for the first time in 41 years next season](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/c51nn7yw1vgo). What an achievement! The dream has become a reality. I never thought I'd see it in my lifetime. (I was barely a year old when Villa won the old European Cup.) The 24/25 season is going to be so special. I can't wait for it to begin.
