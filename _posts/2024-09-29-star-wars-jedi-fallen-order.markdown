I completed the [Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order](https://www.metacritic.com/game/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order/) story yesterday. It's a fantastic game, especially on the PlayStation 5. I was disappointed by the length of the story, but with so many games to play, that's probably not a bad thing! I aim to earn the Platinum trophy and then move on to the sequel, [Star Wars Jedi: Survivor](https://www.metacritic.com/game/star-wars-jedi-survivor/).
