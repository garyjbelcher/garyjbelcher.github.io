Harlan Coben's [Fool Me Once](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt5611024/) on Netflix is an excellent watch. The novel was great, though, so I expected it to be good. I must watch all the other Netflix adaptations of his work that I haven't seen yet when I get the chance, as I'm sure they'll be just as good. Next up on my watchlist, though, is the second season of [Reacher](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt9288030/) on Amazon Prime Video.
