The Book of Doors by [Gareth Brown](https://www.garethbrownbooks.com/) is a fantastic read. I finished it two weeks ago and thoroughly enjoyed the unique, imaginative story. I hope there will be a follow-up book. I suspect a studio will buy the rights to the first one and eventually turn it into a movie.
