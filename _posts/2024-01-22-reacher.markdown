I watched the last two episodes of the second season of [Reacher](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9288030/) over the weekend. Amazon Prime Video has a hit on its hands with this show. It stays (mostly) true to Lee Child's brilliant novels, and Alan Richson embodies Reacher. I can't wait for the third season and, hopefully, many more after that!
