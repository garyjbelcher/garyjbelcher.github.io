I completed [Indiana Jones and the Great Circle](https://www.metacritic.com/game/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/) on PlayStation 5 over the weekend and obtained the all-important Platinum trophy. I enjoyed the game immensely. I'm so glad it didn't remain an Xbox exclusive game (console exclusivity sucks for all players in my humble opinion). I'm looking forward to tackling the DLC next!
