I finished watching the second season of [The Night Agent](https://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-night-agent/) on Netflix last night. The first season was great, and despite having no source material (the first season draws from [Matthew Quirk](http://matthewquirk.com/)'s book of the same name, and he didn't write a follow-up), the second season isn't too bad either. I'm glad to see Netflix has renewed it for a third season. Speaking of third seasons, up next on my watchlist is the third season of [Reacher](https://www.metacritic.com/tv/reacher/) on Amazon Prime Video.
