I've seen a bunch of movies at the cinema recently. [Fall Guy](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1684562/) was excellent and action-packed. (I'd have expected nothing less from the director of [Atomic Blonde](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2406566/) and [Bullet Train](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12593682/).) [Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11389872/) was epic, with outstanding visuals. [IF](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11152168/) was funny and heartwarming, with an ending I should've seen coming but didn't.
