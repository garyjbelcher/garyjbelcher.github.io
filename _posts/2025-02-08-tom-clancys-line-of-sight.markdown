I recently finished reading Tom Clancy's Line of Sight by [Mike Maden](https://www.mikemaden.com/). It features Jack Ryan Jr., the son of Tom Clancy's titular character, Jack Ryan, who works for an off-the-books government agency called The Campus. I enjoyed the previous novel, Tom Clancy's Point of Contact, which Mike Maden also wrote, and this one was just as enjoyable.
