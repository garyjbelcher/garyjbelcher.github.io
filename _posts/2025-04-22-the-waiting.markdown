I recently finished reading The Waiting by [Michael Connelly](https://www.michaelconnelly.com/). After the excellent Desert Star, I was eager to dive into this one as soon as I bought it and continue Ballard and Bosch's journey. The story gripped me from the first page, and I devoured the book in just a few sittings. I can't wait for the next one!
