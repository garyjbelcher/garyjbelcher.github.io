I've just finished reading the latest novel in the Lincoln Lawyer series, The Proving Ground, by [Michael Connelly](https://www.michaelconnelly.com/), and really enjoyed it. It was all about a case against an AI company whose product may have been responsible for a crime, which, given the recent rise of AI everywhere, is not too far removed from reality.
