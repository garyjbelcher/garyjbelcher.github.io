It has been an incredible season so far for the [Villa](https://www.avfc.co.uk/). After yesterday's [win against Chelsea](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/live/c3e0kddvznyt), they are just three points off the top of the table and firmly in the title race. Unai Emery is performing miracles! I don't know if Villa has the squad depth to sustain a title challenge, but do you want to bet against us?
