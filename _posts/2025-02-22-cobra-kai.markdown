As an 80s child, I grew up with the Karate Kid movies. The original three starring Ralph Macchio as Daniel LaRusso are absolute classics. Naturally, I was delighted when I heard about the show on Netflix based on those movies called [Cobra Kai](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7221388/). I've just finished the final season, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It is a lesson for all TV producers in bringing back a classic 80s franchise and updating it for the current era whilst respecting what has gone before. It's not without flaws, of course, and it's a bit silly at times, but on the whole, it's just a fabulous show from start to finish.
