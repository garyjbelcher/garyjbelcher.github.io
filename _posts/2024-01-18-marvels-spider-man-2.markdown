I've recently finished [Marvel's Spider-Man 2](https://www.metacritic.com/game/marvels-spider-man-2/) on the PlayStation 5. Fantastic game. From start to completion, it took around 30 hours to get the Platinum trophy. I'm now working my way through [Horizon Zero Dawn](https://www.metacritic.com/game/horizon-zero-dawn/) on the PlayStation 4.
