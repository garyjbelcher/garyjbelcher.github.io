I've just got back from a week in Rhodes. I had a great time. The weather was perfect. But one thing wasn't: the airport experience - specifically the [Birmingham Airport](https://www.birminghamairport.co.uk/) experience. Honestly, as a proud Brummie, it doesn't give me any satisfaction writing this, but it has to be the worst airport in the world. It seems perpetually under construction, and Security is a nightmare unless you pay for the Express Lane. And don't get me started on the absurd wait time for your luggage at Baggage Reclaim. Airports in other countries put it to shame. It's a poor introduction to Birmingham and the UK for anybody visiting. It's just not good enough.
