Whilst I wait for the release of Ghost of Yotei, and because I am so thoroughly disillusioned by Destiny 2 at the moment, I am working my way through the Batman Arkham series of games by Rocksteady. I've just finished [Batman: Arkham Asylum](https://www.metacritic.com/game/batman-arkham-asylum/) and enjoyed it immensely. I'll be starting [Batman: Arkham City](https://www.metacritic.com/game/batman-arkham-city/) next!
