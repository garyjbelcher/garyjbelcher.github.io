Can you believe we're already more than halfway through July? It has been warm and sunny here for a change, although, in my opinion, a little too warm! I am also another year older and grateful to be so. Thank you to all my friends and family for the cards, presents and well wishes. I'm currently in the middle of the new Destiny 2 expansion, The Edge of Fate. I'll post my thoughts on it later in the week.
