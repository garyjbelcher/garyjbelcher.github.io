I was delighted to hear that Super Unai Emery had [signed a contract extension last week](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/c6pyddj6z8ro). I've said it before, and I'll repeat it: give him whatever he wants. The job he has done since his arrival is nothing short of miraculous. [Aston Villa](https://www.avfc.co.uk/) are fourth in the Premier League, on course for the Champions League next season, and into the semi-finals of the Europa Conference League! Whatever happens between now and the end of the season, it has certainly been one to remember.
