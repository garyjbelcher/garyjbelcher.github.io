As if [EURO 2024](https://www.uefa.com/euro2024/) wasn't enough tournament football to be getting on with, the [Copa América](https://copaamerica.com/en) kicks off later today. Unfortunately, most games start too late for me, but I will try to watch as many as possible. I predict Argentina or Brazil will be the eventual winners.
