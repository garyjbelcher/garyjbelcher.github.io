I've yet to write a post about how well my beloved [Aston Villa](https://www.avfc.co.uk/) are doing, so how about we change that now? They've gone from strength to strength since their return to the Premier League in 2019, especially since Super Unai Emery's arrival in 2022. (The less said about Steven Gerrard's tenure, the better.) Villa are currently second in the Premier League, through to the fourth round of the FA Cup and into the Europa Conference League knockout stage. Honestly, give Unai Emery whatever he wants. He's doing a superb job, and I'm looking forward to the rest of the season without worrying about relegation!
