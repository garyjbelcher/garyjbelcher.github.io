Well, it's July, so I've recently become another year older. I had a lovely birthday and received many cards, presents, and well wishes from friends and family, for which I'm very grateful. [England also beat Switzerland](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/live/crgkevjm6zmt) to book their place in the semi-final of [EURO 2024](https://www.uefa.com/euro2024/), so that was a bonus! The only downer was the weather; what's with all this rain?!
