Yesterday, I completed the campaign in the latest [Destiny 2](https://www.metacritic.com/game/destiny-2/) expansion, [The Final Shape](https://www.metacritic.com/game/destiny-2-the-final-shape/), and I am delighted to say [Bungie](https://www.bungie.net/) nailed it. What an experience. I've stuck by Destiny through thick and thin over the last ten years, playing over 2434 hours across Destiny 1 and 2, and that ending felt so rewarding. I can't quite believe the whole Light and Darkness Saga is over. I'm now looking forward to the Episodes and whatever else comes next!
