I went to [Drayton Manor Resort](https://www.draytonmanor.co.uk/) yesterday with some mates, and I'm sorry to say we left very disappointed. The whole resort needs new ideas and significant investment from its owners. It looked dated. The rides were lacklustre. Food and drink was expensive. I don't remember it being that bad when I was last there. Then again, that was a good while ago. I won't be going again any time soon.
