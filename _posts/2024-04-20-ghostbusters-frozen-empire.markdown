I finally got around to watching [Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21235248/) earlier this week. I'm a child of the 80s and still adore the franchise. The first two movies are absolute classics, and after watching the excellent [Ghostbusters: Afterlife](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4513678/), I was excited for the follow-up. Unfortunately, I was left somewhat underwhelmed. It felt like a movie plagued with studio interference and nowhere near as good as its predecessor. The humour and visual effects were fantastic, though.
