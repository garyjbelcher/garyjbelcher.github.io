It's been almost ten months since I started blogging againâ€”time has flown by! I've enjoyed it, and I plan to keep doing it. However, I'm considering switching from my current static site generator, [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), to something more actively developed. While Jekyll does the job well, it appears to be in maintenance mode, and I've heard about performance issues with sites with more pages. I'm looking into alternatives like [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), [Astro](https://astro.build/), and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and I'll decide soon.
