I've been making the most of my Cineworld Unlimited Card recently. [Bad Boys: Ride or Die](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4919268/) was wild and entertaining. [A Quiet Place: Day One](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13433802/) was a scary and excellent addition to the franchise. [Twisters](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12584954/) was terrific with outstanding visual effects and on par, if not better, than the original [Twister](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117998/). [Despicable Me 4](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7510222/) had me laughing out loud. [Inside Out 2](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt22022452/) and [Harold and the Purple Crayon](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1609486/) were equally charming and heartwarming. My movie of the summer, though, without a shadow of a doubt, is [Deadpool & Wolverine](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6263850/). I highly recommend seeing it while it's still on the big screen.
