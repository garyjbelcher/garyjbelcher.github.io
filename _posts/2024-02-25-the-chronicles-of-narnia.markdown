I've just finished reading The Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis. I started reading them late last year after going to watch a theatre production of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe at the [Birmingham Rep](https://www.birmingham-rep.co.uk/). I'm sure, as a child, I'd read (or had read to me) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, but I'd never read the other books. Anyway, I read them in publication rather than chronological order, [which C.S. Lewis scholars almost universally agree is the best](https://www.cslewis.com/the-narnian-order-of-things/), and thoroughly enjoyed them. C.S. Lewis had such an incredible imagination. I was shocked at how The Last Battle ended, though!
