I was very disappointed to see that [Ghost of Yotei](https://www.metacritic.com/game/ghost-of-yotei/) didn't win a thing at [The Game Awards](https://thegameawards.com/) earlier this month. It is definitely my Game of the Year without a shadow of a doubt. I've just finished the story and obtained the Platinum trophy, and had a thoroughly good time doing so. I really hope some DLC is coming in the future.
