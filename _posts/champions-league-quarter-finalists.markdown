Wednesday night at Villa Park was one to remember. [Villa booked their place in the quarter-finals of the Champions League](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/live/cr42qz1pzgdt) by beating Club Brugge 3-0 (6-1 on aggregate). Their opponent will be PSG, who knocked out Liverpool. What a season this is turning out to be. I've already got my ticket for the PSG game. I'm sure it will be another memorable night!
