Guardian Games is back once again in [Destiny 2](https://www.metacritic.com/game/destiny-2/). It is not my favourite event in the game, but I'm taking part nonetheless. I complained last year about one of the PvP challenges called Crest Collector, hoping that [Bungie](https://www.bungie.net/) would address the unbalanced matchmaking. Unfortunately, it feels the same, if not worse, than last year. I've won only one of my five matches, and the four losses have been absolute massacres. To say that's not fun is an understatement. It's disappointing that nothing has changed despite Bungie having had a year to address these issues.
