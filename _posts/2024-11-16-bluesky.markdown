I recently joined [Bluesky](https://bsky.social/about), and I'm enjoying it so far. It feels like social media shouldâ€”like what Twitter used to be, rather than the toxic environment it has become. While I still use Twitter, I plan to spend more time on Bluesky. You can find me by clicking the social icon below.
