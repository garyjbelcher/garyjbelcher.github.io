I had to write a post about Wednesday night, my first-ever Champions League game at Villa Park. And what a night it was! [Villa beat the mighty Bayern Munich](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/live/cwylq94drj9t) in a repeat of the 1982 European Cup final in Rotterdam, making it two wins out of two in the competition. And who knows how far they can go? It will be challenging, but with Unai Emery at the helm, do you want to bet against us?
