I received the [Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection](https://www.metacritic.com/game/uncharted-legacy-of-thieves-collection/) for PlayStation 5 as a gift some time ago. It includes remastered versions of [Uncharted 4: A Thief's End](https://www.metacritic.com/game/uncharted-4-a-thiefs-end/) (which I had completed on PlayStation 4 many years ago) and [Uncharted: The Lost Legacy](https://www.metacritic.com/game/uncharted-the-lost-legacy/). I recently finished playing The Lost Legacy, and it was fantastic, albeit a bit short. Now, I'm revisiting Uncharted 4: A Thief's End purely for the nostalgia, and it's just as good as I remember.
