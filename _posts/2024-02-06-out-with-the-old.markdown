I dismantled and scrapped my self-built 10-year-old PC over the weekend. It was sat gathering dust in a corner and couldn't even run Windows 11. I've not been a PC gamer for some time (ever since I bought a PlayStation 3), and my MacBook Pro is my go-to machine for everyday use. I did keep the HDD and SSD, though, but for different reasons. I need to sanitise the HDD before scrapping it, and I will be buying a caddy for the SSD so I can reuse it as an external storage device since it's a decent size and still works perfectly. I doubt I'll ever build another PC again. If I ever need or want a Windows-based machine, I might splash out on one of those fancy [Surface](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/surface) laptops instead.
