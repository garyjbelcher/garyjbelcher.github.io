After shutting down my old site in 2018, I always planned to start a new one once I had taken enough of a break. I didn't expect that break to last six years, though! It's good to be back. I may change the theme soon since it's currently using the default [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) one. And I'm also thinking about getting a custom domain name. The blog posts from my old site that I still have around here somewhere may make an appearance at some point too. Happy New Year!
