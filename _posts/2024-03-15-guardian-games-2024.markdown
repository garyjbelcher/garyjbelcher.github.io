I had the worst Crucible experience while grinding the Crest Collector challenge for Guardian Games 2024 in [Destiny 2](https://www.metacritic.com/game/destiny-2/). I was getting stomped almost every other game! The matchmaking felt like it needed to be more balanced; either that or people were cheating. Or I need to get better. I hope [Bungie](https://www.bungie.net/) takes a look at this for next year's event.
