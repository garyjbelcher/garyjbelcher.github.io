Yesterday, I saw something I never thought I'd see: [Aston Villa](https://www.avfc.co.uk/) in the [Champions League draw](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/ce38g41898jo). It's not the same competition Villa won in 1982, but the trophy is still the same. I am so excited to see Champions League football at Villa Park. The fixtures against [Bologna](https://www.bolognafc.it/en/home/), [Celtic](https://www.celticfc.com/) and [Juventus](https://www.juventus.com/en/) will be nights to remember. The most memorable, though, will surely be the one against the mighty [Bayern Munich](https://fcbayern.com/en), the team Villa beat to win the competition in 1982. I can't wait for the games to begin!
