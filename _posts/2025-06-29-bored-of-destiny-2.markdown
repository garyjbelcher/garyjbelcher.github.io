We are just a couple of weeks away from the new Destiny 2 expansion, The Edge of Fate. Although I have pre-ordered it, I have never been more disinterested in Destiny 2 than I am right now. I can't even summon the energy to try the new Rite of the Nine content, even though I've never done any of the dungeons it features. And just recently, Bungie announced that virtually all the armour and weapons we've earned over the past few years are effectively useless in The Edge of Fate, as they've implemented a form of soft sunsetting again, where players will be forced to regrind new armour and weapons every season. As a longtime player, I'm prepared to give the new expansion a chance. But if it continues to make me feel as disinterested as it does right now, I might stop playing altogether.
