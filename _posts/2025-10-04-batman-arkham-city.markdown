I finished the story in [Batman: Arkham City](https://www.metacritic.com/game/batman-arkham-city/) on PlayStation 4 earlier this week. It's better than Arkham Asylum in every way, with the story being particularly fantastic. I was disappointed it was over so soon! I still have many things to go back and collect, but I'll be putting that on hold for the time being, as a game I've been waiting all year for, Ghost of Yotei, has just arrived and will be taking up most of my gaming time for the foreseeable future!
