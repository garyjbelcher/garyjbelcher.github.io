I finished the main story in [Horizon Zero Dawn](https://www.metacritic.com/game/horizon-zero-dawn/) earlier this week. Man, what a great game. It's one of the best PlayStation 4 games I've played, that's for sure. It has such an engaging story and a great protagonist in Aloy. I'm currently wandering the map, finishing off quests, and collecting everything for 100% completion and that all-important Platinum trophy. Then I'll start on The Frozen Wilds DLC.
