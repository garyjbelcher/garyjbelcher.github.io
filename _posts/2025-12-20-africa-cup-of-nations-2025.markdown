It's tournament football time again with the [Africa Cup of Nations 2025](https://www.cafonline.com/caf-africa-cup-of-nations/) kicking off on Sunday evening. Morocco must be one of the favourites to lift the trophy, given they are the hosts, but I'm sure current holders Ivory Coast and Egypt will be in contention too. I'll be watching as many of the games as I can.
