I recently finished watching the second season of [FUBAR](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13064902/) on Netflix. I really enjoy the show, especially Arnold Schwarzenegger's comedic performance, so you can imagine my disappointment when I found out Netflix had cancelled it. In this age of streaming, it is all too easy for the big players to cancel shows without a second thought for the people who watch and enjoy them, and that really sucks.
