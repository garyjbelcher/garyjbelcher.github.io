Well, it's Christmas Eve once again. I've completed my shopping, wrapped the presents, put them under the tree, and written the cards. All that's left to do now is kick back and relax whilst keeping an eye on the big man's progress across the globe via the [NORAD Santa Tracker](https://www.noradsanta.org/en/). Merry Christmas!
