I finished the main story in [Horizon Forbidden West](https://www.metacritic.com/game/horizon-forbidden-west/) on PlayStation 5 this afternoon. It is a brilliant game and a worthy follow-up to the excellent [Horizon Zero Dawn](https://www.metacritic.com/game/horizon-zero-dawn/). The open world feels twice as big and is visually spectacular; the soundtrack is excellent, and the story is just as engaging. I'm currently wandering around the vast open world, finishing off quests and collecting everything for 100% completion and that all-important Platinum trophy before starting The Burning Shores DLC.
