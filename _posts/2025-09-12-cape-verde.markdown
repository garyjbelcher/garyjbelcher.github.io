I've just got back from a wonderful week away in Cape Verde. I saw Lemon Sharks and Loggerhead Sea Turtles in their natural habitats, which were magical experiences, and the weather was sunny and warm throughout. It's an impoverished country, but I highly recommend considering it for your next summer getaway.
