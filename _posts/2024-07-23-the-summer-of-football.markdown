A fantastic summer of football is now (sadly) over. England reached the final of [EURO 2024](https://www.uefa.com/euro2024/) for a second successive time. However, as in the final four years ago against Italy, [they fell short against Spain](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/live/cp68zzx8x4rt), who were excellent throughout the tournament and deserved winners. Argentina meanwhile reached the final of the [Copa Am√©rica](https://copaamerica.com/en) for the second successive time, but unlike England, [they beat their opponents Colombia](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/live/clwy1ljp971t) to win the Copa for a record 16th time.
