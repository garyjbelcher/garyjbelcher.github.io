I recently finished watching the third and, unfortunately, final season of [Bosch: Legacy](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14168162/) on Amazon Prime Video. Like the previous seasons, this one was excellent, so I was very disappointed to hear that the show did not get renewed for a fourth season due to budgetary constraints. That explains why the final episode felt rushed, I guess. Bad decision, Amazon. Bad decision. At least I have the spin-off show [Ballard](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt26676904/) to look forward to, which I plan to watch in due course.
