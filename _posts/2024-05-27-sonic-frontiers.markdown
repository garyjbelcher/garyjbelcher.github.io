I'm currently finishing off the excellent [Sonic Frontiers](https://www.metacritic.com/game/sonic-frontiers/) on PlayStation 5. I'm not a fan of the fiddly controls, and I'm not too fond of how the game pulls you out of the action with cut scenes every so often, but other than that, the open world is a delight, and the soundtrack is top-notch. I've thoroughly enjoyed the game and am delighted to hear [rumours of a follow-up](https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2024/04/rumour-sonic-frontiers-2-in-the-works-say-multiple-sources).
