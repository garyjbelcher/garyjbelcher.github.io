I recently finished watching the fourth (and final) season of [Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5057054/) on Amazon Prime Video and enjoyed it immensely. My only criticism is that it felt rushedâ€”kind of like how the final season of Game of Thrones felt. Despite taking some liberties with certain characters and not following the source novels, I enjoyed all four seasons. I'm disappointed that there won't be any more.
