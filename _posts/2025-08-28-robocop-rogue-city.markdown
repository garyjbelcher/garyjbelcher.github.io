I finished [RoboCop: Rogue City](https://www.metacritic.com/game/robocop-rogue-city/) on PS5 earlier this week. The game is a bit rough around the edges, but it faithfully adapts the first two movies of the late 80s and early 90s and is enormous fun to play. In fact, I had so much fun I'm doing something I have never done before: I'm playing it again in New Game Plus mode so I can mop up some achievements I missed the first time around and get that all-important Platinum trophy!
