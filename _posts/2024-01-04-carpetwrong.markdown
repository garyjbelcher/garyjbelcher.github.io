I made the mistake of buying vinyl flooring from [Carpetright](https://www.carpetright.co.uk/) last year. I didn't have this site then, so I couldn't write about it. From start to finish, the experience was a nightmare. They sold me the more expensive door bars when cheaper ones were available. The screeding needed doing twice. And the vinyl fitting was half-assed and not finished to a neat and acceptable standard. They did put everything I complained about right without fuss. (Apart from the vinyl fitting, which I didn't complain about as I was fed up by then.) I will not be using them again, though. And I would suggest you think twice before doing so, too. Carpetright? More like Carpet*wrong*.
