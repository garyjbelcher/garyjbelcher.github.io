I made the mistake of buying vinyl flooring from [Carpetright](https://www.carpetright.co.uk/) last year. I didn't have this site up then, though, so I couldn't write about it. From start to finish, the experience was a nightmare. They sold me the more expensive door bars when there were cheaper ones available. The screeding needed doing twice. And the vinyl fitting was half-assed and not finished to a neat and acceptable standard. They did put right everything I complained about without fuss. (Apart from the vinyl fitting, which I didn't complain about as I was so fed up by then.) I will not be using them again, though. And I would suggest you think twice before doing so too. Carpetright? More like Carpet*wrong*.
