It has been three months since I decided to start blogging again, and it's going well. I've gotten into a good cadence of posts, and using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) makes it ridiculously easy. I am still thinking about tinkering with the theme, getting a custom domain name, and reinstating the posts from my old site, but one thing at a time. Happy Easter!
