Over the weekend, I finished The Lost Fleet: Outlands Volume 3 - Implacable by [Jack Campbell](https://www.jack-campbell.com/). As I'm sure you're aware by now, I'm a big fan of space opera-type novels, and The Lost Fleet series is one of my all-time favourite series. This instalment of the series was just as good as all the rest, and the tension towards the end of the story kept me gripped and reading well past my bedtime!
