Just before Christmas, I completed the [Star Wars Jedi: Survivor](https://www.metacritic.com/game/star-wars-jedi-survivor/) story on PlayStation 5. What a fantastic game. It's better than the first game and then some. I was not expecting the twist towards the end nor the emotional impact of the ending. Respawn Entertainment did a great job. I can't wait for the third instalment!
