Man, I can't believe it is nearly Christmas again. I also can't believe it's been almost two years since I resumed blogging again! It has been a busy, eventful year for me, and I'm looking forward to a well-deserved two weeks off when I break up from work next week. I need to get my Christmas shopping done first, though!
