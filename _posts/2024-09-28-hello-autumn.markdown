It's Autumn, one of my favourite times of the year. The last nine months have flown by. In the blink of an eye, it will be Halloween, then Christmas, and the year will be almost over! Crazy. Speaking of Halloween, I'm looking forward to the upcoming Festival of the Lost event in Destiny 2. It and The Dawning are my two favourite events in the game. And still on the spooky theme, if you've not seen [Beetlejuice Beetlejuice](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2049403/), you should. It's just as wacky and weird as the original movie!
