I recently finished Nightshade by one of my favourite crime authors, [Michael Connelly](https://www.michaelconnelly.com/). The story takes place primarily on the island of Catalina, just off the coast of California, and features a new character, Detective Stilwell. As always, I thoroughly enjoyed the book, and for once, I correctly guessed who the killer was! Stilwell inhabits the same world as Bosch, Ballard and Haller (The Lincoln Lawyer), so I'm sure he'll interact with one or more of those characters in future books.
