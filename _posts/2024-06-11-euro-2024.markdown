[EURO 2024](https://www.uefa.com/euro2024/) kicks off on Friday evening, and I can't wait. I thoroughly enjoy tournament football. After the disappointment of losing the 2020 final, I hope England can go one step further this time and win it, but they've been far from convincing in their warm-up games. My money is on one of Germany, France, Italy or Spain lifting the trophy.
