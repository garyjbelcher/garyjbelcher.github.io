I recently finished watching [Countdown](y) on Amazon Prime Video. It was really entertaining with some great performances. I don't understand why the first season didn't close with episode ten instead of starting a brand new story for the remaining episodes. But that's irrelevant now since the show was cancelled—on a cliffhanger, no less—a couple of days ago! I really hate it when they do that.
