I completed [Stellar Blade](https://www.metacritic.com/game/stellar-blade/) on the PS5 this morning and achieved the "Making New Memories" ending. What an excellent game. I didn't want it to end. The enemy designs were spectacular, the soundtrack was sublime, and the story was engaging. The platforming controls were a bit fiddly, and I was disappointed with the way the endgame is handled (to obtain the other endings and complete any remaining achievements, including the Platinum, you have to replay it multiple times). However, these are minor complaints. I am very much looking forward to the follow-up game.
