I recently finished Embers of War by [Gareth L. Powell](https://www.garethlpowell.com/). I'm a big fan of space opera-type novels, and I've wanted to read this one for quite some time. It was worth the wait. It's a delightful novel with an intriguing plot and great characters; I particularly enjoyed the Trouble Dog chapters. I've added the other two books in the series to my Want to Read shelf on Goodreads.
