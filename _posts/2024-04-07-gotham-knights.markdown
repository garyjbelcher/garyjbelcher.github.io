[Gotham Knights](https://www.metacritic.com/game/gotham-knights/) on the PlayStation 5 is an excellent game. It has received many unwarranted negative reviews, though, that are undeserved. I'm enjoying my play-through immensely. Okay, there are some noticeable frame rate issues, and the crafting system feels unnecessary, but on the plus side, Gotham looks incredible, and the story is compelling. I have a few more trophies to obtain (including the all-important Platinum one!), and then I'll be done.
