Well, it could have been a better January for [Aston Villa](https://www.avfc.co.uk/). They picked up just one point in the Premier League, slipped to fourth in the table, and have won just once in the last five games. Yikes! Unai Emery knows what he's doing, though; this is just one of those rough patches that almost every team goes through at one time or another, right?
