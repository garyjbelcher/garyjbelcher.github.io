I finished watching the second season of [Bosch: Legacy](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14168162/) on Amazon Prime Video earlier this week. I was a massive fan of its predecessor, [Bosch](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3502248/), and the first two seasons of this show have been just as good. It does the [Michael Connelly](https://www.michaelconnelly.com/) books proud. I can't wait for the third season.
