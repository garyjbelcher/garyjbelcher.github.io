Old Trafford is never a happy hunting ground for Villa, and it proved so again yesterday [after they lost 2-0 to possibly the worst Manchester United side in my lifetime](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/live/cvgvvkegl42t). That result cost Villa a place in next season's Champions League, meaning they will play in the Europa League instead. It might have been different had a very controversial refereeing decision gone Villa's way, but in the end, they only had themselves to blame for an abject final-day performance. Still, it has been another season to remember, and whilst it's not quite the glamour of the Champions League, I'll still be looking forward to the Europa League next season!
