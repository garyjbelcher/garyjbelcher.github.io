I enjoy watching football tournaments and look forward to the [Africa Cup of Nations](https://www.cafonline.com/caf-africa-cup-of-nations/) starting this evening. The opening game is Ivory Coast (who are the hosts) versus Guinea-Bissau. Cameroon are my pick for tournament winners. I don't know why; it's just a feeling I have.
