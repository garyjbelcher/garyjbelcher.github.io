I've been a [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/garyjbelcher) user for a long, long time. Over the years, I've 'scrobbled' the songs I've listened to through various apps such as Windows Media Player and, more recently, [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com) on Android. The integration with Spotify is excellent, but the dreaded double-scrobble bug is a significant issue. It's incredibly annoying, and I've long searched for a solution since neither Last.fm nor Spotify has shown any sign of fixing it. Well, I've finally found a solution. After listening to your music and the last song has been scrobbled, turn off the Spotify integration in your [Last.fm settings](https://www.last.fm/settings/applications). You'll need to turn it on again the next time you start listening, but this (for me, at least) stops the double-scrobbling! Give it a try, and let me know if it also works for you.
