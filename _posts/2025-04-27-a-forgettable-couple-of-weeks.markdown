I was at Wembley yesterday to see Villa [crash out of the FA Cup against Crystal Palace](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/live/cwyn1103qrxt) with a dismal semi-final performance. It capped a forgettable couple of weeks with Villa also [crashing out of the Champions League](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/live/ckgr4n77yy3t) in the quarter-finals despite a terrific performance against an excellent PSG side. There's only the Premier League left to play for now, and whilst Villa are still in the hunt for a Champions League place next season, [defeat to Manchester City earlier in the week](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/live/ckg2420n65kt) has put a dent in that pursuit.
