Well, I've been playing the new Destiny 2 expansion, [The Edge of Fate](https://www.metacritic.com/game/destiny-2-the-edge-of-fate/), for the past couple of weeks and as promised, here are my thoughts. The campaign was great. I enjoyed all the missions, and I'm excited to see where the story goes next. I also really like the new Portal, especially the Solo Ops missions - I wish there were more of them. I am not a fan of the new levelling system, though, nor the new gear tiering system. I think that needs a drastic rethink; otherwise, I don't see myself playing as much, if at all, in the future.
